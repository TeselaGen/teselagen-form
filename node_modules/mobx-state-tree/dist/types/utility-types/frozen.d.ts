/**
 * Frozen can be used to story any value that is serializable in itself (that is valid JSON).
 * Frozen values need to be immutable or treated as if immutable. They need be serializable as well.
 * Values stored in frozen will snapshotted as-is by MST, and internal changes will not be tracked.
 *
 * This is useful to store complex, but immutable values like vectors etc. It can form a powerful bridge to parts of your application that should be immutable, or that assume data to be immutable.
 *
 * Note: if you want to store free-form state that is mutable, or not serializeable, consider using volatile state instead.
 *
 * @example
 * const GameCharacter = types.model({
 *   name: string,
 *   location: types.frozen
 * })
 *
 * const hero = GameCharacter.create({
 *   name: "Mario",
 *   location: { x: 7, y: 4 }
 * })
 *
 * hero.location = { x: 10, y: 2 } // OK
 * hero.location.x = 7 // Not ok!
 *
 * @alias types.frozen
